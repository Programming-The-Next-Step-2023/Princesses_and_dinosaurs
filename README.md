# Princesses_and_dinosaurs

A shiny app for children who stay in a shelter, with games that are fun
and (maybe) teach some valuable lessons too!

### Main structure of the app

There will be buttons with the name and pictures, that will open a game
or a song to listen to. There will be one button to change the theme
from princesses to dinosaurs and vice versa.

### Game

I have not made a final decision on the game or game it will have, it
will be based on my programming skills and the possibilities within R. I
do have some ideas:

#### Idea 1: Memory

This game will be based on the existing game memory-hex:
<https://github.com/dreamRs/memory-hex>

#### Idea 2: Numbers

The princes/dinosaur needs help with counting to 10. The screen will
show 10 blocks with numbers from one to 10, one is missing. There are 3
numbers to choose from, can the child pick the right number?

*To deal with frustrations, the children learn that it is oke to be
upset. But if you cant change it, you can feel better if you count to 10
and shrug it of. So learning how to count to 10 will help them.*

#### Idea 3: Stop!

The buttons walk and stop will make the princes/dinosaur walk or stop.
If the walk sign is up, the princes/dinosaur has to walk. If the stop
sign is up, they have to stop.

*It can be hard to deal with boundaries and to stop when someone tells
you to. This is a fun way to practice.*
